# Showing Typographic work

As explained in the [colophon](/colophon) several decisions have gone into the typography of this site. As some of it is fairly subtle, this page will show it off some more.

## Headers 

There are six full levels of headers available, though normally only three levels are used. First three are *cross-heads*, which means that they're centered. The first two levels are decorated with a symbol on either side, though the third level isn't.

The headers are all following the typographic scale suggested in [Typeplate], with the exception of the sixth level which is the same font-size as the paragraphs. They also all are smallcaps.

The fourth and fifth levels are *indented sideheads*, meaning they are left-aligned, with an indent equal to the paragraphs. To distinguish the fifth level further it is italic.

Finally the sixth level is a *run-in sidehead* which means that it is the same size as the paragraph, the same colour as the paragraph, but still keeping the smallcaps to make it clearly distinguishable from the paragraph.

## Paragraphs

The first paragraph is decorated with a single symbol before it, and there is no indent outside of that. The one exception is a paragraph following a run-in sidehead header, as the effect of the run-in sidehead would be spoiled.

Paragraphs following a paragraph, like this one, has an indent matching the indented sideheads.

## Demo: Header 2
This is a paragraph following a second-level header, much like most of the paragraphs in this explanation, but made more explicti.

### Demo: Header 3
This is a paragraph following a third-level header. The third level header is judiciously spread throughout the pages of the site, so it is also likely noticed.

#### Demo: Header 4
This is a paragraph following a fourth level header. Notice how the decoration and the header match each other quite nicely.

##### Demo: Header 5
This is a paragraph following a fifth level header. It is in much like the fourth level header, but smaller and uses an attractive italic.

###### Demo: Header 6
This is a paragraph following a sixth level header. This will very rarely be used, but it is declared to give more variety, if it s needed. Note how there is no decoration on this paragraph, and that the header appears to be part of it.

This is the second paragraph following a sixth level header, notice the different in text-indents compared to the others.
