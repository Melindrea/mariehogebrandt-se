# Automation in building and developing using Yeoman
<entry>
Needing to run repetitive tasks is boring and a waste of time. Let's make it better, using Yeoman!
</entry>

I dislike repetitive tasks. I dislike needing to do the exact same thing over and over again, and it's not getting better just because it's something you have to do for the quality of your code.

What kind of tasks am I talking about?

- Linting PHP and JavaScript
- Compiling Sass to CSS
- Screenshot on various browser widths
- Upload the latest version of the site/theme with FTP
- Concat and minify JavaScript
- Etc...

So, what can be done about this?
