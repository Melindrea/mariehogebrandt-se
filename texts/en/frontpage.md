# Marie Hogebrandt â€” <span>Developer, Role Player, Idealist</span> #

I live in Sweden and work at [Pineberry](http://www.pineberry.com) in Stockholm as a developer (mainly PHP/WordPress, some Python) since 2012. 

In my spare time I explore the new and cool things that pop up every so often, discard some fairly soon, though others stick with me. I am a bit of an inspiration butterfly, and jump from project to project aimlessly. I will write for a month or two, then do [digital art](/gallery) for a month or two, pick up the redesign of my page for the umpteenth time, etc. Unfortunately these butterfly tendencies are paired with a certain amount of perfectionism, which is one of the reasons I lose interest: I can't get something as awesome as I want it to be, so I just stop.
